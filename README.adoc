# JWT RBAC for MicroProfile

## Introduction

Today, the most common solutions involving RESTful and microservices security are based on http://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect(OIDC)], https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth2] and https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[JSON Web Token (JWT)] standards.

This specification outlines how the signed JWT tokens issued by OIDC and other trusted providers can be verified and their claims used for role based access control(RBAC) of microservice endpoints.

## Motivation

For RESTful based microservices, security tokens in a JWT format offer a lightweight and interoperable way to propagate identities across different services, where:

* Services donâ€™t need to store any state about clients or users
* Services can verify and introspect the token locally if it follows a JWT format or remotely with the trusted provider.
* Services can identify the caller and verify a given service is indeed an indended audience of the token.
* Services can enforce authorization policies based on the information within the token.
* Services can use the token for both delegation and impersonation of identities.
