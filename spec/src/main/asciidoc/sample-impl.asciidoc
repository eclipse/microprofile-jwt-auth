## Sample Implementations

This sections references known sample implementations of the Eclise MicroProfile JWT RBAC authorization specification.

### General Java EE/SE based Implementations

A baseline sample implementation that is available under the Apache License, Version 2.0
can be found at https://github.com/MicroProfileJWT/microprofile-jwt-auth-prototype. The purpose
of this prototype is to offer reusable code for integration of the JWT RBAC authenticaiton
and authorization spec in various container environments. This particular implementation contains:

* a default implementation of the JsonWebToken interface
* a JAX-RS ContainerRequestFilter prototype
* JSR-375 IdentityStore and Credential prototypes
* TODO: a JSR-196 ServerAuthModule

### Wildfly Swarm Implementations

A sample implementation for a custom auth-method of MP-JWT with the Wildfly/Wildfly-Swarm Undertow web container, as a
Wildfly-Swarm fraction, available under the Apache License, Version 2.0 can be found at:
https://github.com/MicroProfileJWT/wfswarm-jwt-auth-fraction.
