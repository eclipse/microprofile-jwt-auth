## Recommendations for Interoperability

The decision about using MicroProfile JWT(MP-JWT) as a token format depends on the agreement between both identity
providers and service providers. This means identity providers - responsible for issuing tokens - should be able to
issue tokens using the JWT format in a way that service providers can understand in order to introspect the token and
gather information about a subject. To that end, the requirements for the MicroProfile JWT are:

1. An authentication token, and
2. An authorization token that contains Java EE application level roles directly or indirectly granted via groups
3. Can be mapped to IdentityStore in JSR375
4. Can support additional standard claims described in https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml

To meet those requirements, we introduce 3 new claims to the MP-JWT:

* "upn": A human readable claim that uniquely identify subject or user principal of token.
* "groups": The subject's group membership.
* "roles": The application roles that the subject has been granted directly and indirectly through groups claim.

### Required Claims
The recommended minimum set of MP-JWT claims is then:

typ:: This JOSE header parameter identifies the token as an RFC7519 and must be "JWT" https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-5.1[RFC7519, Section 5.1]
alg:: This JOSE header parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm used to secure the JWT. MP-JWT requires the
 use of the RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 SHA-256 algorithm and must be specified as "RS256", https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.1[RFC7515, Section 4.1.1]
kid:: This JOSE header parameter is a hint indicating which key was used to secure the JWT. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7515#section-4.1.4[RFC7515, Section-4.1.4]
iss:: The MP-JWT issuer. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.1[RFC7519, Section 4.1.1]
sub:: Identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. See the "upn" claim for how this relates to the container
 java.security.Principal. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2[RFC7519, Section 4.1.2]
aud:: Identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.3[RFC7519, Section 4.1.3]
exp:: Identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.  The processing of the
    "exp" claim requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the "exp" claim.
    Implementers MAY provide for some small leeway, usually no more than a few minutes, to account for clock skew.
    Its value MUST be a number containing a NumericDate value. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4[RFC7519, Section 4.1.4]
iat:: Identifies the time at which the JWT was issued.  This claim can be used to determine the age of the JWT.  Its
    value MUST be a number containing a NumericDate value. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.6[RFC7519, Section 4.1.6]
jti:: Provides a unique identifier for the JWT. The identifier value MUST be assigned in a manner that ensures that
    there is a negligible probability that the same value will be accidentally assigned to a different data object;
    if the application uses multiple issuers, collisions MUST be prevented among values produced by different issuers
    as well.  The "jti" claim can be used to prevent the JWT from being replayed.  The "jti" value is a case-sensitive
    string. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.7[RFC7519, Section 4.1.7]
upn:: This MP-JWT custom claim is the user principal name in the java.security.Principal interface, and is the caller
    principal name in javax.security.enterprise.identitystore.IdentityStore. If this claim is missing, fallback to
    the http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims["preferred_username", OIDC Section 5.1] should be
    attempted, and if that claim is missing, fallback to the "sub" claim should be used.
groups:: This MP-JWT custom claim is the list of group names that have been assigned to the principal of the MP-JWT.
    This typically will required a mapping at the application container level to application deployment roles, but a
    common mapping is one-to-one between group names and application role names.
roles:: This MP-JWT custom claim is the list of role names as specified in the application deployment, in @RolesAllowed
    annotations for example. When the MP-JWT is being used across application, the manager of the IDP must ensure that
    any role names in this claim are consistent across the applications.
NumericDate:: A JSON numeric value representing the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC until the specified
    UTC date/time, ignoring leap seconds

An example minimal MP-JWT in JSON would be:
```json
{
     "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "RS256",
    "kid": "abc-1234567890"
}
{
       "iss": "https://server.example.com",
       "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
       "jti": "a-123",
       "exp": 1311281970,
       "iat": 1311280970,
       "sub": "24400320",
       "upn": "jdoe@server.example.com",
       "groups": ["red-group", "green-group", "admin-group"],
       "roles": ["auditor", "administrator"]
}
```
This specification defines a JWTPrincipal java.security.Principal interface extension that makes this set of required
claims available via get style accessors. The JWTPrincipal interface definition is:

```java
package org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt;
public interface JWTPrincipal extends Principal {

    /**
     * Returns the unique name of this principal. This either comes from the upn claim, or if that is missing, the
     * preferred_username claim. Note that for guaranteed interoperability a upn claim should be used.
     *
     * @return the unique name of this principal.
     */
    @Override
    public String getName();

    /**
     * Get the raw bearer token string originally passed in the authentication header
     * @return raw bear token string
     */
    public String getRawToken();

    /**
     * The iss(Issuer) claim identifies the principal that issued the JWT
     * @return the iss claim.
     */
    public String getIssuer();

    /**
     * The aud(Audience) claim identifies the recipients that the JWT is intended for.
     * @return the aud claim.
     */
    public String[] getAudience();

    /**
     * The sub(Subject) claim identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT. This is the token issuing
     * IDP subject, not the
     *
     * @return the sub claim.
     */
    public String getSubject();

    /**
     * The jti(JWT ID) claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT.
     * @return the jti claim.
     */
    public String getTokenID();

    /**
     * The exp (Expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on
     * or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing in seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC
     * @return the exp claim.
     */
    public long getExpirationTime();

    /**
     * The iat(Issued at time) claim identifies the time at which the JWT was issued in seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC
     * @return the iat claim
     */
    public long getIssuedAtTime();

    /**
     * The groups claim provides the group names the JWT principal has been granted. This would need to
     * be mapped to application roles using a container group to role mapping.
     *
     * This is a MicroProfile specific claim.
     * @return a possibly empty set of group names.
     */
    public Set<String> getGroups();


    /**
     * The roles claim provides the role names the JWT principal has been granted. These are application domain
     * level roles that should map directly to deployment @RolesAllowed specifications.
     *
     * This is a MicroProfile specific claim.
     * @return a possibly empty array of group names.
     */
    public Set<String> getRoles();

    /**
     * Access the names of any other claims not in the explicitly supported MicroProfile mandated claims that
     * are associated with this token.
     * @return non-standard claim names in the token
     */
    public Set<String> getOtherClaimNames();

    /**
     * Access the value of a non-standard claim.
     * @param claimName - the name of the claim
     * @return the value of the indicated claim if it exists, null otherwise.
     */
    public Object getOtherClaim(String claimName);
}
```

### Additional Claims
The JWT can contain any number of other custom and standard claims, and these are made available from the JWTPrincipal
getOtherClaim(String) method. An example MP-JWT that contains additional "auth_time", "preferred_username",
"acr", and "nbf" claims is:

```json
{
     "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "RS256",
    "kid": "abc-1234567890"
}
{
   "iss": "https://server.example.com",
   "aud": "s6BhdRkqt3",
   "exp": 1311281970,
   "iat": 1311280970,
   "sub": "24400320",
   "upn": "jdoe@server.example.com",
   "groups: ["red-group", "green-group", "admin-group"],
   "roles": ["auditor", "administrator"],
   "jti": "a-123",
   "auth_time": 1311280969,
   "preferred_username": "jdoe",
   "acr": "phr",
   "nbf":  1311288970
}
```

### Service Specific Authorization Claims
An extended form of authorization on a per service basis using a "resource_access" claim has been postponed to a future
release. See <<resource_access,Future Directions>> for more information.

## Mapping MP-JWT Tokens to Java EE Container APIs

The requirements of how a JWT should be exposed via the various Java EE container APIs is discussed in this section.
For the 1.0 release, the only manadatory container integration is with the JAX-RS container, and injection of
the MP-JWT types.

### CDI Injection Requirements

#### Injection of JWTPrincipal
An MP-JWT implementation must support the injection of the currently authenticated caller as a JWTPrincipal with
@RequestScoped:

```java
@Path("/endp")
@DenyAll
public class RolesEndpoint {

    @Inject
    private JWTPrincipal callerPrincipal;

```

#### Injection of JWTClaimPrincipal

```java
@Path("/endp")
@DenyAll
public class RolesEndpoint {

...

    @JWTClaim("raw_token")
    private String token;;
```

#### javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()
The Principal returned from these methods MUST be an instance of org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken.

#### javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext#isUserInRole(String)
This method MUST return true for any role name that is included in the MP-JWT "groups" claim, as well as for any
role name that has been mapped to a group name in the MP-JWT "group" claim.

### Mapping from @RolesAllowed
Any role names used in @RolesAllowed or equivalent security constraint metadata that match role names in either
the MP-JWT "roles" claim, or role names that have been mapped to group names in the MP-JWT "group" claim, MUST result
in an allowing authorization decision wherever the security constraint has been applied.

### Recommendations for Optional Container Integration
This section describes the expected behaviors

#### javax.security.enterprise.identitystore.IdentityStore.getCallerGroups(CredentialValidationResult)
This method should return the set of names found in the "groups" claim in the JWT if it exists, an empty set otherwise.

#### javax.ejb.SessionContext.getCallerPrincipal()
The java.security.Principal returned from this method MUST be an instance of org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken.
#### javax.ejb.SessionContext#isCallerInRole(String)
This method MUST return true for any role name that is included in the MP-JWT "roles" claim, as well as for any
role name that has been mapped to a group name in the MP-JWT "group" claim.

#### javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest.getUserPrincipal()
The java.security.Principal returned from this method MUST be an instance of org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken.
#### javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest#isUserInRole(String)
This method MUST return true for any role name that is included in the MP-JWT "roles" claim, as well as for any
role name that has been mapped to a group name in the MP-JWT "group" claim.

#### javax.security.jacc.PolicyContext.getContext("javax.security.auth.Subject.container")
The javax.security.auth.Subject returned by the PolicyContext.getContext(String key) method with the standard
"javax.security.auth.Subject.container" key, MUST return a Subject that has a java.security.Principal of type
org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken amongst it's set of Principals returned by getPrincipals(). Similarly,
Subject#getPrincipals(JWTPrincipal.class) must return a set with at least one value. This means that following code
snipet must not throw an AssertionError:

```java
    Subject subject = (Subject) PolicyContext.getContext("javax.security.auth.Subject.container");
    Set<? extends Principal> principalSet = subject.getPrincipals(JWTPrincipal.class);
    assert principalSet.size() > 0;
```

## Mapping MP-JWT Token to Other Container APIs
For non-Java EE containers that provide access to some form of java.security.Principal representation of an authenticated
caller, the caller principal MUST be compatible with the org.eclipse.microprofile.jwt.JsonWebToken interface.
