[[resource_access]]
## Future Directions
In future versions of the API we would like to address service specific role and group claims. The "resource_access"
claim originally targeted for the 1.0 release of the specification has been postponed as addition work to determine
the format of the claim key as well as how these claims would be surface through the standard Java EE APIs needs
more work than the 1.0 release timeline will allow.

For reference, a somewhat related extension to the OAuth 2.0 spec
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-campbell-oauth-resource-indicators-02[Resource Indicators for OAuth 2.0]
has not gained much traction. The key point it makes that seems relevant to our investigation is that the service
specific grants most likely need to be specified using URIs for the service endpoints. How these endpoints map to
deployment virtual hosts and partial, wildcard, etc. URIs needs to be determined.
