A baseline reference implementation that is available under the Apache License, Version 2.0
can be found at https://github.com/starksm64/microprofile-jwt-auth-ri. The purpose
of this RI is to offer reusable code for integration of the JWT RBAC authenticaiton
and authorization spec in various container environments. This particular implementation contains:

* a default implementation of the JWTPrincipal interface
* a JAX-RS ContainerRequestFilter prototype
* JSR-375 IdentityStore and Credential prototypes
* TODO: a JSR-196 ServerAuthModule

### Wildfly Swarm Implementations

A reference implementation for a custom auth-method of MP-JWT with the Wildfly/Wildfly-Swarm Undertow web container
